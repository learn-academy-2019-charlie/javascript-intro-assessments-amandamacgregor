# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!  Also google for best answer to include as a second option

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a factory to run code through to produce replicatable results; DRY.  
If you know you'll be creating code and running it through conditionals or loops to evaluate the input, 
this is a good opportunity to reduce repeat code and set a block of code to handle an action.

GOOGLE ANSWER:
Function, generally speaking, is a “subprogram” or a reusable piece of code that 
is designed to perform a particular task.
It is composed of a series of statements called function body. 
Values can be passed to a function and the function can/will return a value.

#### 2. What is a method?
A function that belongs to a class.

GOOGLE ANSWER:
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. 
A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.length ; .toUpperCase ; .substring

GOOGLE ANSWER:
.includes() - Determine if string contains substring
.indexOf() - Finding the index of a substring
.split() - Converts string into an array of strings
.charAt() - Returns the character at an index



#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessor has more of a 'check' functionality, whereas mutator changes the thing itself.  Ie, an array of
car family = [anne, bob, charlie] would be permanently changed from the addition of a new baby (or dog)

GOOGLE ANSWER:
Accessor methods only let you look at data--they don't change it. Think of them as read-only.
Mutator methods let you change data.  To put this a different way, they're read-write capable.
-or-
Accessor is a checker, but Mutator is a changer.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() is a way for me to see what's happening in my code.
return is more of an internal function for the code; it can create and store the 
variable needed for the next step, for example.

GOOGLE ANSWER:
The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return
value like you would have use a variable value.
-or-
"console.log" is a way for the machine to tell you, the programmer something and
"return" is a mechanism for the machine to tell another part of its program something.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
Bringing things back to the big picture - I need context to fit the small pieces into 
to make any sense of it.  Seeing things like the github process so I know where in the process each 
part is allows me to actually grasp what I'm doing and the impact of that action.
